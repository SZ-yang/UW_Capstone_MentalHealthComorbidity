Capstone to complete graduate studies at the University of Washington, sponsored by the Seattle Children's Hospital. Studied mental health comorbidities among youth presenting for a substance-related visit to pediatric hospitals.

# Aim 1: Describe trends in pediatric hospital visits for substance related visits by common co-morbid mental health conditions.

In describing trends in visits, we assess the number of incoming visits (AKA incoming volume or simply volume). We plot this quantity over time and compare start to end periods. We fit a smooth line to its trend, and estimate its trend using appropriate methods.

## Summary

(i) Rank each mental health diagnosis by proportion among substance related visits.

*Which experienced the greatest growth?*

(ii) Rank each encounter type by proportion among mental health visitors

*Which experienced the greatest growth?*


## Overall trend

(a) Calculate the incoming volume at each hospital for three periods: (i) Year; (ii) Season, defined by Spring (Mar-May), Summer (Jun-Aug), Autumn (Sep-Nov), and Winter (Dec-Feb); and (iii) Month.

(b) Plot average volume over time and fit a smooth line.

*What seems to be the trend in the number of incoming substance-related visits to pediatric hospitals? Does this trend seem interrupted once the COVID-19 pandemic began?*

(c) Quantify the percent change (AKA percent growth) in incoming volume for both the annual and seasonal time periods, as compared to their initial value.

(d) Organize the percent growths into two tables, one for years and one for seasons. Make separate tables for the number of incoming volume at the initial and final periods.

(e) Plot these percent growths over time.

*What seems to be the trend in percent growth for incoming substance-related visits to pediatric hospitals? Does this trend seem interrupted once the COVID-19 pandemic began?*

## Any mental health symptom/diagnosis trend

Repeat (a) - (c), exclusively for the number of incoming patients whose diagnosis involved any mental health symptom/diagnosis

## Substance Use Disorder (SUD) trend

Repeat (a) - (c), exclusively for the number of incoming SUD patients

## Indication of overdose trend

Repeat (a) - (c), exclusively for the number of incoming patients who exhibited experience of overdose

## Indication of self-harm / suicide
